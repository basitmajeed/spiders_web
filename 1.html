        <h2 style="color: khaki; background-color: steelblue">Pahalgam</h2>
        <p>
            Pahalgam is a very nice place and a very famous tourist destination.
            It is around 100 KM far from the city of Srinagar. It has beautiful
            meadows and it has the famous Betaab Valley. It is also a staring
            point for the famous alpine lake treks of Tarsar and Marsar.
            Thousands of Hindu tourist visit every year in order to complete
            their pilgrimage.

        <h2 style="color: khaki; background-color: steelblue">Sonmarg</h2>
        <p>
            Who has not heard of Sonmarg? One of the best off beat and heat
            escape spot of Kashmir. I hosts the infamous Thajiwas glacier.
            Whenever you visit, you are bound to find snow, which is a treat to
            the eyes. It is also a destination stop to Ladakh.

        <h2 style="color: khaki; background-color: steelblue">Gulmarg</h2>
        <p>
            Gulmarg is the most famous tourist destination in my opinion. It is
            a great hillstation that hosts lots of horses, grass and the famous
            Gandola. One can travel from Phase-I to Phase-II where you are bound
            to find snow. It is a very cool place and a overall nice and
            relaxing place.
